# Grover's Algorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of Grover's search algorithm using Qiskit. 
The code constructs the oracle for marking the state |101‚ü©, prepares a uniform superposition, applies the diffusion operator (inversion about the mean), and builds the complete Grover circuit. 
It then simulates the circuit on a local Qiskit Aer simulator and runs the circuit on real IBM Q hardware.
